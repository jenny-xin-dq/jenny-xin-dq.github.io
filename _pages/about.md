Hi there, 

I'm Jenny Xin! I am a risk-taker who moved across country from Boston to San Francisco during pandemic to pursue a masterâ€™s degree in **business analytics**. I am innately curious, data-savvy, and always ready to roll up my sleeves to solve the tough problems. 

Studied in multiple countries and interacted with classmates from all around the world, I empowered myself with a better global perspective and expose myself to more approaches to solving business cases. I have a passion for solving problems with data analysis and is equipped with analytical skills using Python, R, SQL, Dataiku, MongoDB and Tableau.

I was born and raised in a beautiful historic city called Nanjing. I'm also a dancer (jazz & hiphop), a pianist, a swimmer, a hiker, an animal lover, a foodie, a traveler and currently trying to be a tennis player. I look forward to sharing more stories with you.
