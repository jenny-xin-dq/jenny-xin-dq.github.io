Hi there,

I'm Jenny Xin! I am an experienced Data Analyst with 3 years in management consulting. My expertise includes leveraging advanced tools and programming languages such as Python, SQL, and R to derive strategic insights and deliver impactful solutions. I am proficient in data analysis tools like Tableau, Jupyter Notebook, AWS, and MySQL Workbench.

I have a proven track record of success, having pioneered self-service dashboards, which earned the prestigious Project of the Year award in 2021. My work also includes designing predictive models to analyze risk and optimize pricing strategies, improving market positioning and risk mitigation for key stakeholders. Additionally, I led the deployment of a Joomla-based portal integrated with Tableau analytics to streamline project delivery and enhance decision-making processes.

Beyond technical skills, I excel in project management, client engagement, and team leadership. I am committed to continuous learning and dedicated to excellence in data-driven decision-making.

I was born and raised in the beautiful historic city of Nanjing, China and currently reside in San Francisco. Outside of work, I am a dancer (jazz & hip hop), pianist, swimmer, hiker, foodie, traveler, and aspiring pickleball player. I look forward to sharing more stories and connecting with you!
